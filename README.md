# Give Miami Day x Rebecca's birthday 2020

[Give Miami Day](https://www.givemiamiday.org/) is the biggest fundraising day for hundreds of South Florida nonprofits, organized by the Miami Foundation. It takes place each year in November.

This year, for my birthday, in lieu of any type of party (already out of the question, due to COVID-19), I decided to dedicate my day to raising money on Give Miami Day for five organizations that support causes particularly near and dear to my heart.

In order to streamline the process of sharing each individual fundraising page with friends and family, I threw together a quick Markdown page with background info and links, hosted on Github pages.

## Results

I am blown away to say that the fundraiser was a resounding success! We were able to not only meet my total goal ($2,500) but healthily surpass it with a grand total of $2,766!

Looks like I'll have to go even bigger next year...ðŸ¤”
