Greetings! Thanks for being here.

## It's that time of year again

You all really pulled out all the stops for my [birthday fundraiser](https://rebwill.github.io/give-miami-day-2020/) last year, raising a whopping total of $2,766.16 😮 I've decided to — you guessed it — do it again this year!

Last year my birthday fell in the midst of the peak (_a_ peak?) of the pandemic. While things are marginally better now, due largely to widespread access to the vaccine, for many people it continues to be a slow march of crushing financial, medical, and emotional challenges, with grief, trauma, sickness, and loss still their constant companions. 

With that being said, I am by far the exception to the rule this year, and millions of our friends, family, and neighbors have suffered unthinkable losses and serious financial, medical, and emotional blows. **For this reason, in lieu of gifts, I would like to turn my birthday into an opportunity for a larger impact — and what better way to do so than to take advantage of [Give Miami Day](https://www.givemiamiday.org/): one of the biggest [fundraising days](#faqs) of the year for hundreds of South Florida nonprofits)!!**

If — at the risk of sounding presumptuous — you were considering getting me something for my birthday, **I'd love nothing more than for you to redirect those resources to a donation to one of the below organizations between November 16-19th**. There are so many organizations doing incredible and necessary work in South Florida, but I've narrowed it down to a few that are particularly near and dear to my heart. I'd love for you to check them out and consider helping me reach my fundraising goals for whichever one(s) speak(s) to you!

## FAQs

### ➡️ What is Give Miami Day?

From their [About](https://www.givemiamiday.org/about) page:
> One of the nation's biggest 24-hour annual giving events, Give Miami Day is an online campaign where all locals are philanthropists. This year -- as our nonprofit community continues their essential work in the face of a serious pandemic, economic crisis and the impact of systemic racism -- Give Miami Day will be more vital than ever. While we all count on Miami-Dade's nonprofits to serve our region day after day, this time, they're counting on us. 

> On Thursday, November 19th, 2020, we invite everyone to explore the online profiles of hundreds of Miami-Dade nonprofits that, with limited resources and staff, always find a way to provide the supplies, services and support our residents need. We encourage you to find a cause or an organization you believe in and make a charitable donation.

> Since 2012, Give Miami Day has raised more than $61 million.

## My Selected Organizations

There are hundreds of nonprofits raising money on Give Miami Day that are doing excellent and necessary work, and I wish I could fully fund them all! In the meantime, I have selected five of my favorites for us to focus on this year. Check them out below!

### ➡️ [Miami Waterkeeper](https://www.givemiamiday.org/rebecca-mwk)

The word that comes to mind when I think of Miami Waterkeeper's work is FIERCE. Their ferocious work has played a critical role in protecting our reefs from development projects and pollution; stopping sewage leaks that threaten our ecosystem; applying pressure to the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant to clean up its environmental impacts; the recently successful campaign to reduce fertilizer runoff into Biscayne Bay, which causes both acute and chronic die-offs of seagrass and marine life; among many more efforts.

Along with their legal advocacy efforts, Miami Waterkeeper runs science and research programs, keeping their finger on the pulse of Biscayne Bay, along with community outreach programs training local residents to become defenders and advocates of our waters. Whether we know it or not, we *all* rely on Miami Waterkeeper's efforts much more than many of our residents and leaders realize. **Join me in protecting the lifeblood of our community — clean water and healthy marine ecosystems — and supporting Miami Waterkeeper this Give Miami Day.**

### ➡️ [WeCount!](https://www.givemiamiday.org/rebecca-wc)

Low-wage, immigrant agricultural workers are among the hardest hit communities by COVID-19. With few resources even before the pandemic, affected by layoffs in many industries, and ineligible for most state or federal forms of assistance, many families are struggling to meet basic needs like food and housing. All of this is compounded to their struggles even before the virus, like wage theft, working conditions, and legal vulnerability. 

**WeCount! works to provide legal, social, and survival support for these families, and in April launched a mutual aid fund that has distributed nearly $200,000 in direct cash assistance to immigrant workers, along with broadcasting health and safety information related to the coronavirus via their community radio station, Radio Poder 97.7 FM.**

### ➡️ [The Black Collective](https://www.givemiamiday.org/rebecca-tbc)

**Led by accomplished local leaders, the Black Collective works to promote a shared agenda to elevate political consciousness and amplify the economic power of Black communities.** Their programs target critical initiatives like the 2020 Census, ensuring that everyone in our community is accounted for in funding, representation, and more over the next 10 years; the Freedom Fellowship for local leaders focused on voter engagement and community education; a trilingual 2020 Voter Guide; and more. They also launched a mutual aid fund to support families and individuals in need, in partnership with The Smile Trust and The Miami Climate Alliance.

### ➡️ [Lotus House](https://www.givemiamiday.org/rebecca-lt)

Lotus House is dedicated to improving the lives of homeless women, youth and children. They currently provide housing, food, shelter, education, therapeutic support, and more for over 500 women and children, most of whom are people of color whose lives have been marked by poverty, violence, and discrimination. As you can imagine, the needs that Lotus House is working to meet are greater than ever as even more families have gone into crisis this year — in addition to the fact that they had to cancel their largest fundraising event of the year.

**Guided by trauma-informed, evidence-based, best practices, Lotus House is a bright light amidst difficult and dangerous times for many women, youth, and children, offering support for basic needs, education, therapy, and more.** They are more in need of our support than ever.

### ➡️ [The Alliance for GLBTQ Youth](https://www.givemiamiday.org/rebecca-agy)

The Alliance supports GLBTQ youth and their families through care coordination services; family advocacy and support; education and awareness activities; practice and evidence-based research development; youth enrichment activities for GLBTQ youth; and oversight of a service partnership composed of mental health, education/training and advocacy community-based organizations invested in the holistic well-being of GLBTQ youth.

Studies show that GLBTQ youth experience high rates of harassment, bullying, stress, being kicked out of their home, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation or attempts. **The Alliance provides safe spaces for GLBTQ youth to share experiences, feel supported, find community, and simply be themselves.** It is the only non-profit organization in Miami-Dade County exclusively committed to providing prevention, early intervention social services, and advocacy to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (GLBTQ) youth, their families, and communities.
