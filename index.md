## It's that time of year again!

You all really pulled out all the stops for my [birthday fundraiser](https://rebwill.github.io/give-miami-day-2020/) last year, raising a whopping total of $2,766.16 😮 That was by far the best birthday present I could have imagined — so I'm doing it again this year!

Last year my birthday fell in the midst of the peak (_a_ peak?) of the pandemic. While things are marginally better now (due largely to widespread access to the vaccine), in many respects it feels like groundhog day — for millions of people, the slow march of crushing financial, medical, and emotional challenges has not let up, and grief, trauma, sickness, and loss continue to be constant companions.

**For this reason, in lieu of gifts, there would be no greater honor on my birthday than to dedicate it to raising money for organizations doing important work.**

If — at the risk of sounding presumptuous — you were considering getting me something for my birthday, **I'd love nothing more than for you to redirect those resources to a donation to one (or both! 🤪) causes I've chosen this year: The Bail Project and the Wet’suwet’en Land Defenders Legal Fund.**

I'd love for you to check them out and consider helping me reach my fundraising goals for whichever one(s) speak(s) to you!

If you aren't able to donate at this time, I completely understand, and would be equally honored if you would consider contributing in any other way, like:
- **Sharing this page or the fundraising pages** with your friends and family who might be interested
- Reading up on these issues and **helping educate your peers and loved ones**, whether it's over coffee in the morning or over the Thanksgiving table.

Without further ado, I present to you these two incredible organizations.

**About:** 

> [The Bail Project](https://bailproject.org/) combats mass incarceration by disrupting the money bail system—one person at a time. We restore the presumption of innocence, reunite families, and challenge a system that criminalizes race and poverty. We’re on a mission to end cash bail and create a more just, equitable, and humane pretrial system. 

**Why bail?**

Approximately 2.5 million people are stuck behind bars each year in "pretrial detention". This means they haven't even gone to trial yet, and are supposedly presumed innocent — but due to an unaffordable cash bail system, they can't pay to get out (like people with access to money would do). In effect, it is the criminalization of poverty — and often race, as this affects people of color disproportionately. This might be a bit of an invisible problem to you if you or your family have not been affected by incarceration, but for millions of people whose loved ones are locked up indefinitely without even having gone to trial, it's deeply, violently unjust.

**Wow, that seems very wrong.**

Indeed. "The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment" [[1]](https://bailproject.org/faq/), and  it is being legally challenged on this basis in several states. Organizations like The Bail Project are working to support people who are in pretrial detention as well as advocate for policy changes.

**Do we even need bail? What's the alternative?**

From The Bail Project's excellent FAQs:

> Cash bail, by definition, is a form of conditional release for a person who has been accused of a crime, but has yet to have a trial. The idea is simple: require people to put an amount of money they can afford on the line and they will have a financial incentive to come back to court until their case is resolved. **Over the past few decades, however, cash bail has become a mechanism for incarcerating low-income people before trial. Judges routinely set bail amounts that people cannot afford, particularly for people of color. As a result, we have a two-tier system where two individuals charged with exactly the same thing are treated differently based on their race and economic status.**

> More equitable approaches do exist. Chief among these is release on recognizance, which allows individuals to return to their communities without bail on the condition that they come back to court as required. While judges across the U.S. already have broad discretion to allow release on recognizance, most continue to set cash bail at unaffordable amounts, keeping people in jail pretrial solely because of their poverty.

> **Our clients’ success in coming back to court demonstrates that cash bail is not necessary to ensure people come back to court.** The Bail Project Community Release with Support Model works, offering an alternative that is more just, equitable, and effective.

**How does the Bail Project National Revolving Bail Fund work?**

> Cash bail is returned at the end of a case when a person has made all their court appearances. Our teams of Bail Disruptors and Client Advocates use standardized court reminder procedures and established social-service partnerships to support our clients in making their court dates. **As their cases close, bail is repaid back into our fund and recycled to help additional clients. As a result, the same donation can be used over and over, creating a massive force multiplier.**

## ➡️ Wet’suwet’en Land Defenders Legal Fund

### 💰 Fundraising pages: 💰 [Unist'ot'en 2020 Legal Fund](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/unistoten2020legalfund/) or [Stand with Wet’suwet’en Land Defenders](https://go.rallyup.com/wetsuwetenstrong/Campaign/Details)

**About** 

The assault on indigenous people and lands has never stopped since European settlers first set foot on what we now know as the North American continent. It continues to this day, and a particularly egregious situation is currently unfolding in Wet’suwet’en territory in so-called northern British Columbia in Canada. It would be my honor to contribute to their fundraising efforts for their legal funds, as they fight to save their land from the egregious violations of the Canadian federal and provincial governments, the RCMP, and Coastal GasLink/TC Energy.

In their requests for support, the Wet’suwet’en specify that contributions should be made directly through their existing fundraising pages, so I have linked to those below.

**Where to donate**
